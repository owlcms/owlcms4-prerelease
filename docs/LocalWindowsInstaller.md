  - The first time you run the file, it is possible that Windows will complain.  Should that be the case Click on **More Info** and then, at the bottom, click on **Run Anyway**

- The first time you run the Control Panel, it will offer to install OWLCMS.  This will download and install the prerequisites (Java), and install the latest OWLCMS.
